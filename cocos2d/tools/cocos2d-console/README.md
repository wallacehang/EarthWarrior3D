## Vision of cocos2d-console


A command line tool that lets you create, run, publish, debug, etcâ€¦ your game. It is the swiss-army knife for cocos2d.

This command line tool is in its early stages.

Examples:

```
# starts a new project called "My Game" for multi-platform

$ cocos2d new "My Game" -l cpp -p org.cocos2d.mygame

$ cd "My Game"

# Will compile the current project to binary
$ cocos compile android -m debug


# Will deploy the project to device and run it
$ cocos run android


```

# Devel Info

## Internals

`cocos.py` is an script whose only responsability is to call its plugins.

To get a list of all the registered plugins:

```
$ python cocos.py
```

To run the "new" plugin:

```
$ python cocos.py project new
``` 

## Adding a new plugin to the console

You have to edit `bin/cocos2d.ini`, and add the class name of your new plugin there. Let's say that you want to add a plugin that deploys the project:


```
# should be a subclass of CCPlugin
project_deploy.CCPluginDeploy
``` 

And now you have to create a file called `project_deploy.py` in the `plugins` folder.
A new, empty plugin, would look like the code shown below:

```python
import cocos

# Plugins should be a sublass of CCPlugin
class CCPluginDeploy(cocos.CCPlugin):

        @staticmethod
        def plugin_category():
          return "project"

        @staticmethod
        def plugin_name():
          return "deploy"

        @staticmethod
        def brief_description():
            return "Deploy the project to target."                

        def run(self, argv, dependencies):
            print "plugin called!"
            print argv

```

Plugins are divided by category, depending on it's function: project, engine, ...
